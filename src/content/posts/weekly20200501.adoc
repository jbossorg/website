== [2020-04-30] - The Virtual Red Hat Summit week

image::/website/img/posts/rh-summit-banner.png[link="https://www.redhat.com/en/summit"]

I'm writing this as we wrap up another successful Red Hat Summit. 
But this year, with a significant distinction: the event was 100% 
virtual. Despite the involuntary move to virtual, there were many 
benefits that came about from the change in format. The event was 
completely free, and of course required no travel, allowing a much 
broader and more diverse set of attendees to benefit from the 
content and experience. It was also ran in three regions to 
accommodate many more timezones.

Being Red Hat we were keen to experiment with the format and find 
new ways to engage with the community. It was important for us to 
carry over as much of the personality and intimacy of the physical 
event as possible. So, this needed to be more than just a bunch of 
streamed talks. The talks were pre-recorded which allowed the 
presenter(s) to participate directly in the Q&amp;A in real-time 
as the talk proceeded. There was also a variety of sessions that 
went beyond the talk format. For examples see 
_Ask the experts_, _Networking social hour_, and 
the _Virtual Open Neighborhood_ on the 
https://www.redhat.com/en/summit/agenda/agenda-at-a-glance[agenda].
